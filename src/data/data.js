    story: `It was past midnight when Aarav boarded the last local train home. The compartment was nearly empty, except for an old man sitting by the window, staring blankly outside.

Aarav took a seat across from him. The train moved forward with a rhythmic clatter, and he pulled out his phone to kill time. The old man suddenly turned to him.

"Are you sure you’re on the right train?" he asked in a raspy voice.

Aarav chuckled nervously. "Yeah, this is the last train to Ambernath, right?"

The old man nodded slowly but didn’t say anything else. Something about his gaze made Aarav uneasy. He decided to ignore him and focused on his phone.

A few minutes later, the train entered a dark tunnel. The lights flickered for a moment before going out completely. The compartment was plunged into pitch-black darkness.

Aarav felt a sudden shift in the air—like someone was moving. A faint whisper echoed through the compartment, but he couldn’t make out the words.

When the train emerged from the tunnel, the lights came back on. Aarav blinked.

The old man was gone.

The seat where he had been sitting was now covered in dust, as if no one had sat there for years. Aarav's heart pounded. He quickly looked around, but the compartment was empty.

The train pulled into the next station. The digital display flickered, showing something that sent chills down his spine:

"Last stop: The Departed."

Aarav scrambled to his feet, his breath shaky. The doors slid open with a hiss. He hesitated—should he step out or stay on the train?

Then, in the reflection of the window, he saw it.

The old man was sitting right beside him. Smiling.`,
